Hi, my name is Luc (my online alias is 'Luke_'), and ive always been curious about the world around me. Ever since I've touched my first computer, I've been wanting to find out how it and its applications worked.


When I was 14 years old I started learning about how to write batch scripts and how to use them to create terminal based text adventure games on windows. From there I ended up shifting towards web development with HTML CSS and JavaScript. Later I also found out about programming outside of the browser, via languages like python and C.


Since then, ive been expanding my skills and knowledge in this area and became really invested into the world of software development. The most important thing about it is not your skills, but your joy, when you practice something that you really enjoy, you automatically gain skill and expertise over time.
