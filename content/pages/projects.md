Over the course of my programming career, ive worked on a lot of different projects. Some of them are still in development, some of them are finished and some of them are just ideas that i never got around to actually finishing.

The following list contains my most proudest projects that I would like to share. I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed making them.

# RMS
RMS (Which stands for Rabbit Management System) is probably my biggest and most passionate project I've ever created. The project originated from me being bothered by having too many webshops to manage, and i wanted some kind of 'template' that is highly customizable and flexible, that I can send over and over again for different projects.

I currently have 2 projects running on this system which are:
- [My dads sausage roll website](https://dewitworstenbrood.nl/)
- [A bakkery website of an old friend of mine](https://bakkerijadriaans.nl/)

RMS Includes the actual frontend website, a backend system in the form of a REST API that communicates with the database and the websites, and a portal for the client owners to manage their products and orders.

# Spike wall
One day I was bored so I decided to do a one-day-challenge where I try to program my favourite mobile game (dont touch the spikes) using VueJS, but to make it more difficult, I didnt use html canvas, but raw DOM elements instead.

The result is a pretty fun game that you can play on [the website](https://justlucdewit.github.io/spike-wall/). My highscore is 42, can you beat it?

# \[secret\] programming language
This one I cant reveal too much about because I want to do one big reveal when its more finished. But I can tell you that its a programming language that I created from scratch, and its a lot of fun to work on.

I've created other programming languages in the past, but this one is the most ambitious one yet. Its a general purpose procedural programming language (my past languages used to be either simple assembly langs, lisps, or concatenative languages) that can be interpreted or transpiled to many different targets including Javascript, Php, Python, and C.

# Typescript terminal pong
This is a pretty simple yet cool terminal game that I created when I was trying to learn typescript.
The source code can be viewed on [github](https://github.com/justlucdewit/pong) and the application can be easily installed as a CLI application via the commands provided in the readme.
